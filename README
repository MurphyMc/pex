POX is a networking software platform written in Python
PEX is the POX Experimental components repository

Basically, PEX is a (possibly temporary) home for things which aren't
ready for prime time POX, but might be useful to others.

Things in PEX may well not work.  They may be broken, dated, or
otherwise hazardous to your health.  They are usually developed atop
the current development branch of POX.

Good luck!
